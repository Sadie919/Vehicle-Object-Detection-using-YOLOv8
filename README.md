# Vehicle-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv8
This project applies the YOLOv8-Medium model for real-time detection of vehicles including ambulances, buses, cars, motorcycles, and trucks. The dataset is sourced from Roboflow and evaluated on train, validation, and test sets. Results show strong detection performance, with potential for improvement through better annotations and additional data.
